    <h2>Chapter 2 — Little Neon Doesn’t Stop for Anyone</h2>
    <p>Little Neon never slept.
        It pulsed.
        Light crawled over buildings like living veins, neon advertisements folding and refolding into new shapes every few seconds. Holographic signs floated between towers, some selling weapons, some selling noodles, some advertising bounties with smiling cartoon mascots that waved as if nothing about the world was wrong. Traffic streamed in stacked lanes above and below the streets, silent mag-vehicles gliding past one another with practiced precision.
        And right now, three people were running through it like they didn’t belong.
        Div stumbled once, caught himself on instinct, and kept moving.
        His lungs burned  -  not the clean burn of exercise, but the ragged kind that came from waking up too soon, from a body that hadn’t fully healed. The world blurred at the edges, lights streaking as his eyes tried to keep up. He didn’t know where he was going. He didn’t know why he was running.
        He only knew that stopping felt wrong.
        “Left - no, RIGHT - ” Rush shouted, his voice cracking as he darted ahead, weaving between pedestrians half his size and twice his mass.
        Daniel, taller and broader, kept pace just behind Div, one hand gripping his side where his injury still hadn’t closed properly. He glanced back once, then again.
        “They’re still on us,” Daniel said, breathless but forcing a grin. “Which, rude, by the way. Didn’t even let us stretch.”
        Div risked a look over his shoulder.
        Two figures cut through the crowd with intent that didn’t match the rest of the city. They moved too efficiently, hands near their weapons, eyes locked forward. Their coats bore faint red threading  -  subtle, but unmistakable.
        Team Red.
        Bounty hunters.
        Div didn’t know how he knew that.
        But the word bounty surfaced in his mind like a warning alarm, cold and heavy.
        “Why - ” Div gasped, vaulting over a waist-high vendor barrier without thinking, his hands finding purchase perfectly. “Why are they after us?”
        Rush slid under the same barrier, popping back up with a wild grin that didn’t quite hide the fear in his eyes. “Because apparently people get paid to be annoying now!”
        Daniel snorted. “Welcome to the economy.”
        They burst through a narrow street packed with stalls. The smell of oil and spices hit Div all at once. Vendors shouted, not in panic, but irritation.
        “Hey! Watch it!”
        “Careful with the crates!”
        A woman barely flinched as a warning shot cracked into the air behind them, sparks dancing harmlessly against a building’s shielded wall.
        Controlled chaos.
        Violence wasn’t rare here. It was just… managed.
        “Ranks?” Div asked suddenly, breath hitching as he vaulted again  -  this time up, fingers catching the edge of a low awning. His body moved before his mind could argue.
        Daniel blinked. “What?”
        “I - ” Div landed hard, knees bending instinctively. “I keep thinking about ranks. And bounties. And IDs.”
        Rush glanced back at him mid-run. “Oh. Yeah. That tracks.”
        “That tracks?” Div snapped.
        Daniel laughed  -  actually laughed  -  despite everything. “Trust me, that’s a good sign. Means your brain’s rebooting.”
        They turned a corner sharply. A massive screen flickered overhead, flashing a rotating list of wanted posters. Div caught a glimpse of faces, numbers, symbols.
        Starters. Goods. Pros.
        His stomach twisted.
        “Why don’t the authorities - ” Div began.
        “Care?” Daniel finished. “Because we’re not breaking city law. Just someone else’s.”
        Another shot rang out, closer this time. Civilians cursed and shifted aside, annoyed more than afraid.
        Rush skidded to a stop in front of a narrow building wedged between two taller structures. No signs. No lights. Just a maintenance door half-hidden behind a flickering ad panel.
        “In here!” Rush hissed.
        Daniel slammed his shoulder into the door, forcing it open just wide enough. They slipped inside as another shot sparked against the frame.
        The door slammed shut.
        Silence crashed down hard.
        Div bent over, hands on his knees, chest heaving. His vision swam, then steadied. His heart was still racing, but something else pulsed beneath it.
        Familiarity.
        He straightened slowly, eyes adjusting to the dim interior  -  a stairwell leading down, dust thick in the air, old wiring exposed along the walls.
        Daniel leaned against the wall, sliding down until he was sitting. “Okay,” he said, grinning weakly. “That went… about a six out of ten.”
        Rush peeked through a crack in the door. “They’re confused. Love to see it.”
        Div stared at his hands.
        They were steady.
        “I shouldn’t be able to move like that,” he said quietly.
        Daniel’s smile softened. “You always could.”
        Div looked up. “Always?”
        Rush turned, expression unreadable for just a second before he masked it with a shrug. “Yeah, well. Guess muscle memory’s harder to kill than people.”
        The words hung heavier than Rush probably intended.
        Outside, Little Neon kept pulsing. Life moved on.
        Inside the stairwell, Div felt the weight of a world he no longer remembered  -  and the strange, terrifying comfort that some part of him still belonged in it.
        Somewhere deep in his chest, something waited.
        Not memory.
        Potential.
        And for the first time since waking up, Div realized something important:
        This wasn’t the end of his story.
        It was the start of learning how to survive it again.
