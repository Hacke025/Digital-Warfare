    <h2>Chapter 2 — Out of Stillness</h2>
    <p>They didn’t leave all at once.<br><br>
Daniel cracked the door first, just enough to peer through the gap. Cold air slipped inside, carrying the scent of smoke and rain-soaked metal. Somewhere outside, something hissed rhythmically, like a machine breathing in its sleep.<br><br>
“Clear,” Daniel said, though his voice carried doubt.<br><br>
Rush was already moving, restless energy pushing him forward. Div followed more carefully, each step reminding him that his body was still catching up to the idea of being alive.<br><br>
They stepped out into a corridor that looked like it had once been important.<br><br>
Wide walkways stretched ahead, lined with dark glass panels and broken light strips that flickered on and off in no discernible pattern. The floor was cracked, sections sagging slightly as if the structure beneath had been damaged and hastily reinforced.<br><br>
Div slowed.<br><br>
The space felt… exaggerated. Too tall. Too wide. Like whoever built it had wanted to impress something larger than a human.<br><br>
“This place,” Div said quietly, “it doesn’t feel finished.”<br><br>
Rush glanced back. “That’s because it isn’t. Or it was. Or it broke. Honestly, it’s hard to tell with cities like this.”<br><br>
“Cities like this?” Div echoed.<br><br>
Daniel looked over his shoulder. “You don’t remember the name?”<br><br>
Div shook his head.<br><br>
“Little Neon,” Daniel said. “It’s one of those places that never really sleeps. Even when it’s half-destroyed.”<br><br>
As if to prove the point, a distant platform far above them lit up, silhouettes of people crossing from one building to another along glowing walkways suspended in open air.<br><br>
Div stared.<br><br>
The city wasn’t built on a single ground level. It stacked upward, layers upon layers of streets and bridges and platforms, some glowing bright with color, others dark and skeletal where damage hadn’t been repaired yet.<br><br>
Traffic flowed vertically as much as it did horizontally.<br><br>
“Feels like I could fall forever,” Div muttered.<br><br>
Rush snorted. “Yeah. That checks out.”<br><br>
They moved slowly, staying near the walls, avoiding the brighter paths where more people walked. Div noticed how Daniel chose routes instinctively-corners, shadows, broken signage. Rush followed, talking under his breath whenever the silence stretched too long.<br><br>
“So,” Rush said casually, “you don’t remember us. But you walk like you’re used to running.”<br><br>
Div frowned. “I do?”<br><br>
“Yeah,” Daniel said. “You don’t hesitate before steps. You check your balance without looking. That’s not beginner behavior.”<br><br>
Div absorbed that quietly. It was strange hearing fragments of himself described like clues at a crime scene.<br><br>
They passed a wide opening where the wall had collapsed entirely, revealing the city beyond. Neon lights painted the fog in shifting colors. Drones zipped between buildings, their paths precise and indifferent. Far below, something massive moved, hidden by distance and haze.<br><br>
Div leaned slightly closer to the opening before Daniel gently pulled him back.<br><br>
“Don’t,” Daniel said. “Open sightlines are bad.”<br><br>
“For what?”<br><br>
Daniel didn’t answer.<br><br>
They reached a lower platform where the corridor opened into what looked like an abandoned transit hub. Tracks ran through the center, warped and silent, with signage flickering between languages Div didn’t recognize but somehow understood anyway.<br><br>
Rush crouched near the edge, peering down the track. “We’re not alone.”<br><br>
Div’s muscles tightened. “You hear something?”<br><br>
“I hear nothing,” Rush replied. “That’s worse.”<br><br>
Daniel raised a hand, signaling them to stop.<br><br>
For a moment, everything was still.<br><br>
Then Div felt it again.<br><br>
That same pressure. That quiet certainty that standing still was a mistake.<br><br>
Footsteps echoed from somewhere above-measured, unhurried. Not civilians. Too deliberate.<br><br>
Daniel exhaled slowly. “Okay. New plan.”<br><br>
Rush’s grin returned, thin and forced. “I hate new plans.”<br><br>
Daniel pointed down one of the side corridors branching away from the hub. “You take that route. We’ll circle around.”<br><br>
Div looked at him sharply. “Wait-”<br><br>
“Just temporary,” Daniel said quickly. “We regroup on the lower platforms.”<br><br>
Rush was already backing away. “You’ll be fine. Probably.”<br><br>
Div didn’t like how easily they said it.<br><br>
The footsteps grew louder.<br><br>
“Go,” Daniel said, more firmly now.<br><br>
Div hesitated for half a second-then nodded.<br><br>
He turned and ran.<br><br>
The corridor swallowed him almost immediately, lights flickering overhead as the sounds of the city faded behind him. His breath came fast, pain flaring at his side, but he kept moving.<br><br>
Behind him, something changed.<br><br>
Shouting. A sharp metallic crack. Rush yelling something he couldn’t make out.<br><br>
Div didn’t stop.<br><br>
Not because he didn’t care.<br><br>
But because, somehow, he trusted them.<br><br>
The corridor bent sharply and then split again, branching into darkness and light. Div slowed just enough to choose-<br><br>
And realized, too late, that he couldn’t hear Daniel or Rush anymore.<br><br>
The city pressed in around him, vast and uncaring.<br><br>
