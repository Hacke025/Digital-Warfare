    <h2>Chapter 3 — Into the Lower Layers</h2>
    <p>Div stepped carefully through the narrow alleyway, the smell of burnt metal and concrete dust lingering in the air. The platform he had fallen from earlier loomed high above him, jagged edges slicing through the dim neon haze. He wasn’t sure how far he had come, or how far he could go before danger found him again.<br><br>
The lower layers of Little Neon had a different rhythm than the bustling streets above. The lights were dimmer, flickering, as if the city had forgotten this part existed. Some panels were missing entirely, leaving gaps that let him see the floors below, where shadows moved like liquid. The hum of machinery was constant, a reminder that the city was alive-even if it didn’t notice him.<br><br>
Every step felt fragile. The metal beneath him groaned with age, and the air smelled faintly of oil and rust. Div kept his hand on the wall and the other close to the gun at his hip, knife brushing against his back as if reminding him it was there. He hadn’t used them yet, but the knowledge that they were there comforted him.<br><br>
Voices drifted from a hallway to his left. Div paused, pressing himself flat against the wall. A pair of low, hurried whispers carried through the space.<br><br>
“…Did you hear? They say he could manipulate code itself. Could make the world bend. He’s gone now, but-”<br><br>
“…Don’t spread that stuff. You’ll get yourself killed. Just the thought of him makes the hunters nervous. He’s not coming back, remember?”<br><br>
Div froze. That’s me… right? His pulse quickened. He had no memory of these feats, no memory of bending reality like the whispers claimed. But the fear in their voices, the awe-it was real. It told him that someone, somewhere, remembered him. And maybe that was enough to keep moving.<br><br>
He stepped back lightly and continued through the twisted hallways. Rusted staircases led to half-floors, abandoned maintenance platforms hung precariously, and scattered signs pointed to sectors he didn’t recognize. Everywhere he looked, the city told a story he wasn’t a part of, and yet somehow, he was expected to navigate it.<br><br>
Eventually, he reached a small square, where a few civilians had set up a makeshift market. The glow of neon advertisements painted their faces in soft blues and purples. They moved carefully around broken crates and cables that crossed the floor, seemingly oblivious to the layers above them.<br><br>
Div observed silently, noting how people moved, how they avoided certain areas, and how they glanced at the shadows as if expecting someone-or something-to appear. He realized quickly: power wasn’t required to survive here. Knowledge, awareness, and timing mattered just as much.<br><br>
He picked up a discarded piece of tech, half-broken and blinking faintly. The way it hummed reminded him faintly of what he used to do with code, though he didn’t know why. He pocketed it anyway, just in case it might be useful. Small tools, small advantages-they were all he had, and for now, that was enough.<br><br>
Hours passed. The streets blurred into each other, and the sun-or whatever little neon glow passed for it-shifted above him. Rumors followed him like shadows. Whispers of the boy who could bend reality, of the battles he had fought, of the base that had been destroyed. Div didn’t know what to believe, but he knew one thing: these stories weren’t here to warn him. They were here to push him forward.<br><br>
By nightfall, he found a small alcove overlooking a neglected transit layer. He sat on a ledge, looking out over a city that was both dazzling and dangerous. Somewhere far below, he thought he saw a flicker of movement-hunters, maybe, or just someone walking too quickly to notice. Either way, it reminded him that no one was coming to save him.<br><br>
Div exhaled slowly. His first real thought of the day. Then I have to do it myself.<br><br>
And with that, he stood. The city stretched ahead of him, full of secrets and dangers. He didn’t know what he would find, but he had a choice: stay still and be forgotten, or keep moving and see where this life of adventure would take him.<br><br>
He chose movement.
