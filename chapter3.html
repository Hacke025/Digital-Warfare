    <h2>Chapter 3 — Escape and Seperation</h2>
    <p>“So let me get this straight,” Div said between breaths, leaning against a cracked pillar as his legs finally stopped shaking. “We’re being chased because I’m… dead?”<br>
Rush snorted, reloading his M6T with practiced speed. “Correction. You’re supposed to be dead. Which makes you expensive.” He glanced down the corridor, then added, “Honestly, sounds like a you problem.”<br>
Daniel didn’t laugh. He crouched instead, one hand pressed against his ribs, jaw tight. “They’ll keep coming. Doesn’t matter how many we shake. Someone will recognize you eventually.”<br>
Div frowned. “Recognize me how? I don’t even know what I look like to them.”<br>
Rush tilted his head. “Trust me, man. When bounty boards light up, people start looking.”<br>
The building they’d ducked into was half-abandoned, half-repurposed - a vertical maze of scaffolding, exposed beams, and maintenance platforms bolted onto the sides of old structures. Outside, Little Neon buzzed like nothing was wrong. Neon signs flickered. Transit rails hummed. Life moved on.<br>
Div noticed things now.<br>
Rush had something around his neck - not jewelry. An artifact. He didn’t know how he knew. He just did. The way it caught light wrong. The way it felt… heavier than it should.<br>
Daniel, too. His movements were sharp but uneven. Pain hid behind control. And that dagger - Div was sure now - it had changed shape mid-throw. He hadn’t imagined it.<br>
“Hey,” Div said quietly. “Rush. That thing you’re wearing.”<br>
Rush blinked. “This?” He tapped the necklace absently. “Oceanic Necklace. Defensive-type relic. Still figuring it out.” He hesitated. “You gave it to me, actually. Before.”<br>
Div’s chest tightened.<br>
Before.<br>
Daniel straightened. “We don’t have time to unpack memories. We need to move again. They’ll flank.”<br>
Right on cue, the wall behind them exploded.<br>
Concrete and metal burst inward as the bounty hunters forced their way through. Smoke flooded the room. Shouts echoed. Boots hit the floor.<br>
Rush raised his gun, hands shaking. “Don’t come closer!”<br>
Daniel grabbed his shoulder. “Rush-”<br>
Too late. Rush fired.<br>
The shot didn’t hit anyone. It filled the space with smoke and noise, buying them seconds at best.<br>
“DIV,” Daniel shouted. “CLIMB. NOW.”<br>
Rush dropped the gun and bolted for the scaffolding. Daniel followed immediately, already scaling the metal framework with brutal efficiency. Div hesitated only a heartbeat before forcing his body to move.<br>
Shots rang out below.<br>
Metal screamed as bullets tore through beams. Crates shattered beneath Div’s feet. A support bar snapped, sending debris crashing down.<br>
He climbed anyway.<br>
Hands burned. Muscles screamed. His lungs felt like they were tearing apart - but his body knew what to do. Vault. Pull. Swing. Leap.<br>
I’ve done this before.<br>
“THEY’RE COMING UP!” Div shouted.<br>
“KEEP MOVING!” Daniel yelled back, reaching down to shove Rush upward when he slipped.<br>
They burst through a maintenance hatch and into open space.<br>
Light hit Div’s eyes.<br>
They were standing on an elevated district - a massive suspended platform layered above the city streets. Shops, walkways, transit nodes, people. A second city stacked atop the first. Digitally exaggerated staircases spiraled between levels. Elevators shot past in transparent shafts. Life existed above life.<br>
“There’s a whole city up here,” Div breathed.<br>
“Focus!” Daniel snapped.<br>
The ground beneath Div roared.<br>
A deafening blast slammed into his side.<br>
Pain detonated.<br>
Div flew.<br>
The world twisted as the RPG round struck the platform near his feet, tearing through the structure. The shockwave ripped metal apart like paper. The ground collapsed beneath him.<br>
He hit hard.<br>
Dust swallowed everything.<br>
“DIV!” Rush screamed.<br>
Div coughed, forcing himself upright. His side burned. His ears rang. Rubble rained around him.<br>
Across the fractured platform, a bounty hunter steadied an RPG launcher, already lining up another shot.<br>
Div locked eyes with him.<br>
Time slowed.<br>
Then Daniel was there.<br>
The dagger flew - morphing mid-air into a heavier form - slamming into the launcher and detonating it sideways. The explosion threw the hunter back in a mess of fire and debris.<br>
“RUN!” Daniel shouted. “NOW!”<br>
Div didn’t argue.<br>
He trusted him.<br>
He turned and sprinted.<br>
Shots chased him as he ran - tables shattered, signs exploded, glass rained down. Div vaulted over railings, slid across panels, leapt gaps he didn’t think about until after he cleared them.<br>
Another bounty hunter broke from the crowd behind him.<br>
“HEY! GET BACK HERE!”<br>
Div didn’t look back.<br>
His bracelet stayed silent. Dormant. Heavy on his wrist.<br>
The city blurred as he ran deeper, faster, instincts dragging him forward. He ducked through a service passage, then another, then burst into a structure mid-transition - a building still being rewritten, half solid, half scaffold.<br>
He slammed the door behind him.<br>
Silence.<br>
His chest heaved. His hands shook.<br>
For the first time since waking up…<br>
Div was alone.<br>
And somewhere behind him, Little Neon kept moving - uncaring, alive, dangerous.<br>
