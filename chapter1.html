<section class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 1 — Wake</h2>
    <p>The first thing Div noticed was the sound.<br>
        Not voices. Not alarms.<br>
        A hum.<br>
        Low, steady, almost comforting - like something working hard in the background to keep everything from falling apart.<br>
        His eyes opened slowly.<br>
        The ceiling above him was wrong.<br>
        Not the smooth white panels he half-expected, not the cracked concrete of a ruin either. This was metal - patched metal - overlapping sheets bolted together unevenly, faint seams glowing where power lines ran beneath. A strip light flickered once, then steadied.<br>
        Div blinked.<br>
        His head felt… heavy. Not pain exactly. More like pressure, as if someone had wrapped his thoughts in thick fabric.<br>
        He tried to sit up.<br>
        Bad idea.<br>
        His body responded with a sharp protest - muscles stiff, lungs burning as if he’d forgotten how to breathe properly. A sound escaped him before he could stop it, something halfway between a groan and a gasp.<br>
        Immediately, movement.<br>
        “ - oh, hey, hey, HEY, don’t do that - ”<br>
        A taller figure leaned into his vision, blocking the light. Dark skin, messy hair pulled back loosely, a faint scar across the forehead that creased when he frowned.<br>
        “Daniel,” another voice snapped from the side. “You’re hovering. Stop hovering.”<br>
        “I’m not hovering,” Daniel said. “I’m being emotionally supportive.”<br>
        “You’re looming.”<br>
        Div’s eyes shifted.<br>
        The second figure was shorter, perched on a crate with his boots hooked around the edge like he couldn’t sit still if his life depended on it. He wore mismatched gear - gloves that didn’t match his jacket, straps buckled purely because they could be. His dark eyes were sharp, scanning Div’s face with something between relief and suspicion.<br>
        “Oh,” the shorter one said. “He’s awake. That’s… wow. That’s actually happening.”<br>
        Div swallowed. His throat felt dry.<br>
        “…Do I,” he began, then stopped. His voice sounded wrong to him - rougher, quieter. “Do I know you?”<br>
        The room went still.<br>
        Not dramatically. Not in a way that screamed tragedy.<br>
        Just… quiet.<br>
        Daniel straightened, then let out a breath he’d clearly been holding for a long time. “Okay. Cool. That’s - yep. That tracks. That’s actually better than screaming, so I’ll take it.”<br>
        The shorter one scoffed. “You say that now.”<br>
        Div’s gaze moved between them. His heart was beating faster - not fear, not yet. Confusion. The kind that felt deeper than forgetting a name.<br>
        “I… don’t remember,” Div said carefully. “Anything.”<br>
        Daniel nodded slowly. “Yeah. We figured.”<br>
        “…figured?” Div echoed.<br>
        The shorter one hopped down from the crate and stepped closer. He was younger - noticeably so - and despite the tension in his shoulders, there was something almost familiar in the way he stood, like he’d done this a thousand times before.<br>
        “I’m Rush,” he said. “Unfortunately.”<br>
        Daniel snorted. “He’s my favorite problem.”<br>
        Rush shot him a look. “You cried when he stopped breathing.”<br>
        Daniel didn’t deny it. “I was stressed.”<br>
        Div watched them.<br>
        The way they spoke. The way they stood close without crowding him. The casualness layered over something raw and careful underneath.<br>
        “…I feel like I should know that,” Div murmured.<br>
        Rush’s expression softened for just a fraction of a second before he masked it with a grin. “Yeah. You should.”<br>
        Div pushed himself up more slowly this time. Someone had wrapped a blanket around him - thin but warm. He looked down at his hands. No restraints. No IVs. Just faint scorch marks along his sleeve, fabric repaired unevenly.<br>
        “Where are we?” he asked.<br>
        Daniel glanced around. “An old base. Abandoned. Mostly.”<br>
        “That’s reassuring,” Div said.<br>
        “We cleaned it,” Rush added quickly. “Well. As much as you can clean a place that got half-melted.”<br>
        Div frowned. The word melted settled oddly in his chest.<br>
        “How long?” he asked. “How long was I - ”<br>
        Daniel answered gently. “Long enough that we were starting to argue about what to do if you didn’t wake up.”<br>
        Rush crossed his arms. “I said we keep him.”<br>
        “That was not helpful,” Daniel said.<br>
        Div almost smiled.<br>
        Almost.<br>
        Then something shifted.<br>
        A faint vibration passed through the floor - so subtle it might’ve been imagination. The hum beneath the base wavered, dipped.<br>
        Rush’s head snapped up. “Did you feel that?”<br>
        Daniel’s posture changed instantly. Relaxed humor gone, replaced with alert readiness. “Yeah.”<br>
        Div’s pulse picked up. “What was that?”<br>
        Daniel met his eyes. “That,” he said, “is probably why we can’t stay here.”<br>
        Rush was already moving, grabbing his gear, checking a compact device strapped to his wrist. “I told you this place was temporary.”<br>
        “You tell me that about everywhere,” Daniel replied, but he was checking his own equipment now - light, efficient movements.<br>
        Div swung his legs over the side of the cot, ignoring the ache. “Who’s after us?”<br>
        They exchanged a glance.<br>
        Rush answered. “People who think you’re dead.”<br>
        Daniel added, quieter, “And people who want to make sure you stay that way.”<br>
        Div stood.<br>
        The world tilted for half a second - then steadied.<br>
        Something in him adjusted. Not memory. Not skill.<br>
        Instinct.<br>
        He took a breath. “Okay,” he said. “Then… we move.”<br>
        Rush grinned, a flash of nerves and excitement mixed together. “There he is.”<br>
        Daniel clapped Div lightly on the shoulder. “Welcome back, man.”<br>
        The lights flickered again.<br>
        Somewhere above them, the city of Little Neon kept glowing - bright, crowded, unaware that three people were about to step back into it with bounties on their names and a future rewritten by survival.<br>
        And Div, walking toward the exit with no past and far too many questions, felt something stir deep inside him.<br>
        Not fear.<br>
        Curiosity.<br>
