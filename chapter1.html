<section class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 1 — Wake</h2>
    <p>The first thing Div noticed was the sound.
Not voices. Not alarms.
A hum.
Low, steady, almost comforting - like something working hard in the background to keep everything from falling apart.
His eyes opened slowly.
The ceiling above him was wrong.
Not the smooth white panels he half-expected, not the cracked concrete of a ruin either. This was metal - patched metal - overlapping sheets bolted together unevenly, faint seams glowing where power lines ran beneath. A strip light flickered once, then steadied.
Div blinked.
His head felt… heavy. Not pain exactly. More like pressure, as if someone had wrapped his thoughts in thick fabric.
He tried to sit up.
Bad idea.
His body responded with a sharp protest - muscles stiff, lungs burning as if he’d forgotten how to breathe properly. A sound escaped him before he could stop it, something halfway between a groan and a gasp.
Immediately, movement.
“ - oh, hey, hey, HEY, don’t do that - ”
A taller figure leaned into his vision, blocking the light. Dark skin, messy hair pulled back loosely, a faint scar across the forehead that creased when he frowned.
“Daniel,” another voice snapped from the side. “You’re hovering. Stop hovering.”
“I’m not hovering,” Daniel said. “I’m being emotionally supportive.”
“You’re looming.”
Div’s eyes shifted.
The second figure was shorter, perched on a crate with his boots hooked around the edge like he couldn’t sit still if his life depended on it. He wore mismatched gear - gloves that didn’t match his jacket, straps buckled purely because they could be. His dark eyes were sharp, scanning Div’s face with something between relief and suspicion.
“Oh,” the shorter one said. “He’s awake. That’s… wow. That’s actually happening.”
Div swallowed. His throat felt dry.
“…Do I,” he began, then stopped. His voice sounded wrong to him - rougher, quieter. “Do I know you?”
The room went still.
Not dramatically. Not in a way that screamed tragedy.
Just… quiet.
Daniel straightened, then let out a breath he’d clearly been holding for a long time. “Okay. Cool. That’s - yep. That tracks. That’s actually better than screaming, so I’ll take it.”
The shorter one scoffed. “You say that now.”
Div’s gaze moved between them. His heart was beating faster - not fear, not yet. Confusion. The kind that felt deeper than forgetting a name.
“I… don’t remember,” Div said carefully. “Anything.”
Daniel nodded slowly. “Yeah. We figured.”
“…figured?” Div echoed.
The shorter one hopped down from the crate and stepped closer. He was younger - noticeably so - and despite the tension in his shoulders, there was something almost familiar in the way he stood, like he’d done this a thousand times before.
“I’m Rush,” he said. “Unfortunately.”
Daniel snorted. “He’s my favorite problem.”
Rush shot him a look. “You cried when he stopped breathing.”
Daniel didn’t deny it. “I was stressed.”
Div watched them.
The way they spoke. The way they stood close without crowding him. The casualness layered over something raw and careful underneath.
“…I feel like I should know that,” Div murmured.
Rush’s expression softened for just a fraction of a second before he masked it with a grin. “Yeah. You should.”
Div pushed himself up more slowly this time. Someone had wrapped a blanket around him - thin but warm. He looked down at his hands. No restraints. No IVs. Just faint scorch marks along his sleeve, fabric repaired unevenly.
“Where are we?” he asked.
Daniel glanced around. “An old base. Abandoned. Mostly.”
“That’s reassuring,” Div said.
“We cleaned it,” Rush added quickly. “Well. As much as you can clean a place that got half-melted.”
Div frowned. The word melted settled oddly in his chest.
“How long?” he asked. “How long was I - ”
Daniel answered gently. “Long enough that we were starting to argue about what to do if you didn’t wake up.”
Rush crossed his arms. “I said we keep him.”
“That was not helpful,” Daniel said.
Div almost smiled.
Almost.
Then something shifted.
A faint vibration passed through the floor - so subtle it might’ve been imagination. The hum beneath the base wavered, dipped.
Rush’s head snapped up. “Did you feel that?”
Daniel’s posture changed instantly. Relaxed humor gone, replaced with alert readiness. “Yeah.”
Div’s pulse picked up. “What was that?”
Daniel met his eyes. “That,” he said, “is probably why we can’t stay here.”
Rush was already moving, grabbing his gear, checking a compact device strapped to his wrist. “I told you this place was temporary.”
“You tell me that about everywhere,” Daniel replied, but he was checking his own equipment now - light, efficient movements.
Div swung his legs over the side of the cot, ignoring the ache. “Who’s after us?”
They exchanged a glance.
Rush answered. “People who think you’re dead.”
Daniel added, quieter, “And people who want to make sure you stay that way.”
Div stood.
The world tilted for half a second - then steadied.
Something in him adjusted. Not memory. Not skill.
Instinct.
He took a breath. “Okay,” he said. “Then… we move.”
Rush grinned, a flash of nerves and excitement mixed together. “There he is.”
Daniel clapped Div lightly on the shoulder. “Welcome back, man.”
The lights flickered again.
Somewhere above them, the city of Little Neon kept glowing - bright, crowded, unaware that three people were about to step back into it with bounties on their names and a future rewritten by survival.
And Div, walking toward the exit with no past and far too many questions, felt something stir deep inside him.
Not fear.
Curiosity.
