<section class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 1 — Wake</h2>
    <p>Div woke up slowly.<br><br>
Not the way people usually wake up-no sharp breath, no sudden jolt. It was more like floating upward through dark water, awareness returning in fragments rather than all at once.<br><br>
The first thing he noticed was sound.<br><br>
A low hum, steady and mechanical, vibrating faintly through whatever surface he was lying on. It reminded him of something distant and familiar, though he couldn’t say why. The second thing was the light-dim and flickering above him, white strips embedded into a metallic ceiling.<br><br>
The third thing was pain.<br><br>
Not sharp, not unbearable, but everywhere. A deep soreness that made his chest tighten when he tried to breathe too deeply, like his body had already decided it had been through enough.<br><br>
He opened his eyes.<br><br>
The room wasn’t a room so much as a compartment-metal walls, exposed panels, cables running along the corners. The air smelled sterile, faintly burnt, like something electrical had overheated recently.<br><br>
None of it felt familiar.<br><br>
Div frowned, then realized something unsettling.<br><br>
The name Div felt familiar-but nothing else did.<br><br>
He tried to sit up.<br><br>
His body protested immediately, muscles burning as if they hadn’t been used properly in a long time. He groaned softly and collapsed back against the surface beneath him.<br><br>
“…Okay,” he muttered hoarsely. His own voice sounded strange to his ears. “That’s new.”<br><br>
A shadow moved.<br><br>
“No-wait, don’t try to get up yet.”<br><br>
Div’s head snapped to the side.<br><br>
Two figures stood a short distance away.<br><br>
One was tall and broad-shouldered, leaning against a wall with his arms crossed, posture stiff like he’d been standing guard for a while. The other was shorter, restless, pacing back and forth with quick, uneven steps.<br><br>
They both froze when Div looked at them.<br><br>
For a moment, no one spoke.<br><br>
“…Who are you?” Div asked finally.<br><br>
The words came out before he could stop them. Honest. Unfiltered.<br><br>
The shorter one blinked. “Oh.”<br><br>
The taller one let out a slow breath. “That’s… not great.”<br><br>
Div’s heart began to pound. Not panic-something colder. Something instinctive.<br><br>
“I’m serious,” Div said. “I don’t-” He hesitated, searching for something in his mind and finding nothing. “I don’t remember you.”<br><br>
The shorter one scratched the back of his head, forcing a crooked grin. “Wow. You really went all-in, huh?”<br><br>
The tall one shot him a look. “Daniel.”<br><br>
“What? I’m coping.”<br><br>
Daniel stepped forward, his expression careful now, eyes studying Div like he might fall apart if handled wrong. “You’re safe,” he said. “As safe as you can be, at least.”<br><br>
Div didn’t feel safe.<br><br>
“Where am I?”<br><br>
Daniel hesitated.<br><br>
“…Not where you started,” he said finally.<br><br>
That answer only made the pounding in Div’s chest worse.<br><br>
The shorter one crouched down closer, peering at Div’s face with unsettling intensity. “Do you remember anything? Your name? Us? The base?”<br><br>
Div shook his head slowly. “I remember… being somewhere else.”<br><br>
Both of them stiffened.<br><br>
“Somewhere normal,” Div continued, struggling to put the feeling into words. “Buildings. Streets. People who didn’t know me. I think… I think I was human.<br><br>”
Silence<br><br>.
Daniel looked away first.<br><br>
“…That was the experience,” he said quietly.<br><br>
“What experience?”<br><br>
The shorter one exhaled through his nose. “Figures. He doesn’t remember the worst part.”<br><br>
Div tried to push himself up again, slower this time. Daniel immediately reached out, steadying him.<br><br>
“Easy,” Daniel warned. “Your body’s still recovering.”<br><br>
“From what?”<br><br>
Another pause.<br><br>
“From dying,” the shorter one said lightly.<br><br>
Div stared at him.<br><br>
“…What?”<br><br>
Daniel shot him a sharp glare. “Rush.”<br><br>
“What? He asked.”<br><br>
Rush shrugged, then softened slightly. “Okay. Not dying. Almost dying. Several times. You were kind of a mess when we found you.”<br><br>
That didn’t feel like a joke.<br><br>
Div swallowed. His mind reached for something-anything-to anchor himself, but there was nothing there. No memories. No skills. No sense of who he had been before waking up on a metal slab surrounded by strangers who spoke like they knew him.<br><br>
“Why do I feel like people are looking for me?” Div asked suddenly.<br><br>
The question surprised even him.<br><br>
Daniel’s eyes snapped back to his.<br><br>
“…What did you say?”<br><br>
“I don’t know,” Div admitted. “It’s just a feeling. Like… staying still is a bad idea.”<br><br>
Rush’s grin faded.<br><br>
Daniel straightened slowly. “That instinct might be the only thing you didn’t lose.”<br><br>
The hum around them deepened. Somewhere beyond the walls, something distant rumbled-an echo, not close enough to be immediate, but not far enough to ignore.<br><br>
Rush stood. “We should move.”<br><br>
Div looked between them. “Move where?”<br><br>
Daniel met his gaze. “Out.”<br><br>
“Why?”<br><br>
Daniel didn’t answer right away.<br><br>
“Because,” he said at last, “whatever you were before… someone didn’t want you waking up again.”<br><br>
Div’s chest tightened-not with fear, but with something sharper.<br><br>
Curiosity.<br><br>
If he had been important enough to erase, then maybe there was something worth finding.<br><br>
He pushed himself to his feet again, slower, steadier this time.<br><br>
“…Okay,” Div said. “Then let’s go.”<br><br>
Rush smiled faintly. “There he is.”<br><br>
Daniel nodded once. “Welcome back, Div.”<br><br>
Div didn’t feel back.<br><br>
But as the compartment door slid open and light spilled in from the ruined world beyond, one thought settled firmly in his mind:<br><br>
This wasn’t the end of his story.<br><br>
